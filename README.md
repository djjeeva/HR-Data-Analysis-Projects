#Creating an HR Report for AtliQ:

In a recent project, I took inspiration from a series by Codebasics, where the focus was on crafting a comprehensive HR report for a company operating in a hybrid work environment. The aim was to process and analyze attendance data to provide meaningful insights to the HR department.

# Challenge:
AtliQ, a company with both in-office and remote employees, needed a detailed analysis of their attendance records for the past three months. The goal was to help HR understand key metrics related to employee presence and preferences.

# Objectives:
* Calculate the attendance rate to gauge employee presence.
* Analyze work preferences to determine the split between remote work and office attendance.
* Identify the frequency and patterns of sick leave usage among employees.
