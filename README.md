## Creating an HR Report for AtliQ:

In a recent project, I took inspiration from a series by Codebasics, where the focus was on crafting a comprehensive HR report for a company operating in a hybrid work environment. The aim was to process and analyze attendance data to provide meaningful insights to the HR department.

## Challenge:

AtliQ, a company with both in-office and remote employees, needed a detailed analysis of their attendance records for the past three months. The goal was to help HR understand key metrics related to employee presence and preferences.

## Objectives:

- Calculate the attendance rate to gauge employee presence.
- Analyze work preferences to determine the split between remote work and office attendance
- Identify the frequency and patterns of sick leave usage among employees.


## My work 
Working through this project has been an invaluable learning experience for me. My next step would be to develop a new project entirely from the ground up, using the knowledge I’ve gained. I plan to delve into the data myself, identify key patterns, and provide actionable insights as a Data Analyst. The goal is to enhance the company’s operations and boost overall efficiency
